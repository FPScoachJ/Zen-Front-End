# Welcome to Flow Finder, a productivity page blending eastern philosophy and western productivity practices.

![ICAR Homepage](/readMeImages/flowFinderHomepage.png)

Flow Finder spawned over the course of a week as my frontend project for my Software Development bootcamp with DigitalCrafts.  As users navigate through the various pages, they are encouraged to engage in various stages of the creative process.

You will find the Medium article I wrote on this project [here](https://medium.com/@justin.m.anzalone/flow-finder-a-productivity-app-for-everyone-c565a138ec15).

## Skills Demonstrated

- HTML
- CSS -- Navbar design, flexbox, css grid, transitions, transforms, media queries
- JavaScript - DOM Manipulation, Functions (Asynchronous, and Synchronous), Event Listeners
- API Utilization from [ZenQuotes](https://zenquotes.io/)

## Resources Utilized

- [CleanStart.page](https://cleanstart.page/) - While brainstorming the project, I stumbled across CleanStart.  I immediately resonated with the aesthetic and it served as inspiration for the homepage of my project.
- [Pomodoro-Timer](https://freshman.tech/pomodoro-timer/) - I completed this code along in order to implement a Pomodoro Timer into my project.  
 - [Unsplash images for homepage](https://awik.io/generate-random-images-unsplash-without-using-api/) - I originally inteded to use the Unsplash API to generate the background images, but settled on generating an image randomly with appropriate parameters.

 ## Lessons Learned

 1. Mobile First.  Despite the instructions clearly stating to design with mobile responsiveness in mind, this was the last piece of functionality I added.  I was fortunate that my project's aesthetic theme was fairly simple.
 2.  Complete the campaign before attempting side quests.  What I mean by this is that my original vision was to truly recreate the Clean Start design utilizing a number of API's.  However, at my current skill level, that type of functionality combined with the time constraints of the assignment led me to significantly scale back the homepage.  Fortunately, I recognized early on that I would need to revisit the homepage at a later date with more time and once my skills have increased.
 3.  Sketch design.  I will admit that visual design is not my strong suit.  Taking time to get design thoughts onto paper gave me a framework.  I believe if I had nothing to adhere to, my design would not have come together as efficiently as it did.
 4.  Solve an actual problem.  Originally I set out with the idea of using an NHL API to allow a user the ability to build a "dream team" of current and former players.  However, after taking a few moments to reflect on what could serve me at this point in my programming career (and into the future!), I settled upon designing something to increase productivity.  I believe by taking additional time before I began the project, the benefit to myself (and hopefully others) has increased and my inspiration to work on the project did not wane as the minutes turned to hours, and the hours turned to days.
